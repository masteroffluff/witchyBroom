# WitchyBroom

**WitchyBroom** is a simple browser-based game built with Phaser 3, featuring a Halloween-themed adventure. The player controls a witch flying through a city through walls made of skulls. The goal is to last as long as possible before colliding with a skull. This project was undertaken for the Spooktober Challenge at Codecademny and was completly produced in under 24 hours from the start (about 10 hours total work time). 
It is based on Flappy Bird by Dong Nguyen.

## Features
